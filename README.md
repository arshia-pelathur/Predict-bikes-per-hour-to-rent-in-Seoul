# Predict-bikes-per-hour-to-rent-in-Seoul

Currently, Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern.
The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes. The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour, and date information.

### Problem Statement: 
The aim of our model is to predict the number of bikes that will be required each hour for rental

### Features in the dataset:

1. Date : day-month-year
2. Rented Bike count : Count of bikes rented at each hour
3. Hour : Hour of the day
4. Temperature : Temperature in Celsius
5. Humidity : Humidity in Percentage
6. Windspeed : Windspeed in m/s
7. Visibility (10m) : Visibility in metres
8. Dew point temperature : in Celsius
9. Solar radiation : MJ/m2
10. Rainfall : mm
11. Snowfall : cm
12. Seasons : Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn
13. Holiday : Holiday/No holiday
14. Functional Day - No(Non Functional Hours), Yes(Functional hours)
